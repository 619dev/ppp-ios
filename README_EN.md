## About

This repository is the **iOS native client** fork of [PaperPhone+](https://github.com/619dev/Paperphone-plus). PaperPhone+ is a WeChat-style end-to-end encrypted instant messaging application featuring stateless ECDH + XSalsa20-Poly1305 per-message encryption with forward secrecy.

This project uses [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) to package the React + TypeScript frontend as a native iOS application, with APNS push notification support. It is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paperphoneplus/id6769265178).

## 🔐 Extra-encrypted text appearance: design and security boundary

This feature is **extra insurance on top of the existing end-to-end encryption (E2EE)**. It does not replace E2EE with a visual encoding, and it never bypasses or weakens the original encryption. Private chats remain protected by the existing X25519 / ML-KEM-768 key agreement and message-encryption path; group chats continue to use the Sender Key protocol. Identity private keys and group Sender Keys remain protected by iOS Keychain.

When enabled, every message is processed in this order:

1. The sender first protects the message body with the extra password shared by both participants or by all group members. PBKDF2-SHA-256 (210,000 iterations and a random salt) derives an AES-256-GCM key; every message has an independent random IV and an authentication tag for integrity.
2. The complete extra-encryption frame (version, salt, IV, and ciphertext) is then encoded with one of eight selectable text appearances. This is not merely decorative character substitution: the visible characters carry the extra encrypted ciphertext.
3. That appearance ciphertext then enters the project's original encryption path: private-chat E2EE or group Sender Key encryption. The server still receives the original E2EE/Sender-Key ciphertext plus metadata required for delivery.
4. The recipient reverses the order: first decrypt the original E2EE/Sender-Key layer, then decode the text-appearance frame and decrypt the body with the extra password.

The extra password is never uploaded, synchronized automatically, or distributed by the server. Both people in a private chat must set the same password; every group member who needs to read the plaintext must also set that same password. Text appearances do not need to match: every message carries its own appearance identifier, so the recipient automatically detects and decodes the sender's choice. For example, one person may send Buddhist text while another sends Hangul; if the extra password matches, both decrypt normally. A user's appearance setting controls only the ciphertext appearance of messages they send. If the password is missing, locked, or different, messages are still sent and received normally and the original E2EE layer still decrypts successfully, but the app can display only the appearance ciphertext—not the original text.

The app does not persist the extra password. While unlocked it exists only in the current process memory; locally, the app stores only a random salt and AES-GCM verification data used to check whether an entered password is correct. Users can lock immediately or automatically 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes after the app leaves the foreground. This layer adds an independent shared secret beyond E2EE; it does not replace a strong password, device lock, or system secure storage, and it cannot provide absolute protection on a fully compromised device while the password remains in memory.

```bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

## APNS Push Notification Setup

This project uses APNS (Apple Push Notification Service) for native push notifications.

### Prerequisites

1. A valid Apple Developer account
2. Create an APNS Key (.p8 file) in the Apple Developer Portal
3. Enable Push Notifications capability in Xcode

### Backend Configuration

Configure in the backend `server/.env`:

```env
APNS_TEAM_ID=your_team_id
APNS_KEY_ID=your_key_id
APNS_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
APNS_BUNDLE_ID=com.fm619tech.paperphoneplus
APNS_SANDBOX=false    # Use true for TestFlight, false for App Store
```

Or use the official push relay (no Apple credentials needed):

```env
APNS_RELAY_URL=https://619.chat
APNS_RELAY_KEY=EzmpqftbsENaRUO6BTABxLV96q7RuEDyokXJr1DWdDjL54cLg7yXVUQqydCQvxrX
```

When a push or message arrives, or a conversation is marked as read, the app recalculates the total unread count and synchronizes the iOS home-screen badge.

---

## Group Meetings

Group voice and video meetings use a LiveKit SFU, so each device maintains only one upstream connection and can scale better for multi-party calls. The backend `/api/calls/meeting-token` endpoint supplies meeting credentials and participant limits; a full deployment therefore requires a LiveKit service configured on the backend.

- The meeting creator becomes the host and can mute everyone.
- In discussion mode, participants can unmute themselves. Switching to lecture mode mutes non-host participants and prevents them from unmuting.
- The client enables adaptive stream and dynacast to reduce bandwidth usage in multi-party video meetings.

## Login Session Behavior

Ordinary network loss, WebSocket reconnection, proxy changes, IP changes, or a single HTTP 401 response do not immediately clear local login state. The client signs out only after an explicit server signal for session revocation, forced logout, account disablement, or account deletion.
